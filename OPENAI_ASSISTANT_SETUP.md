# OpenAI Assistant Integration

## Overview

This project now uses an OpenAI Assistant (`asst_DoFkThnJXJ0ZEzHTNDdVzhf7`) for legal research instead of direct calls to the Chat Completions API. This change provides several benefits:

1. Consistent persona and instructions
2. Access to specialized tools configured in the assistant
3. Better context management through threads
4. Potential access to retrieved documents from a knowledge base

## Technical Implementation

The integration uses the OpenAI Assistants API to:

1. Create a new thread for each conversation
2. Add the user's message to the thread
3. Run the assistant on the thread with the specific assistant ID
4. Poll for completion of the run
5. Retrieve and return the assistant's response

## Environment Variables

The Supabase Edge Function requires:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key with access to the Assistants API

## Assistant Configuration

The OpenAI Assistant is configured with:

- ID: `asst_DoFkThnJXJ0ZEzHTNDdVzhf7`
- Model: GPT-4 (configured in the OpenAI platform)
- Custom instructions: Legal research assistant specialized for Nigerian legal context

## Deployment Instructions

```bash

```

## Testing
